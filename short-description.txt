The MAS is described in the report availble in the GitHub repo. The project is about integrating Multi-Agent 
Systems ( MAS ) concepts into an energy prosumer simulation tool to model decentralized peer-to-peer ( P2P ) 
electricity trading. 

OBJECTIVE: The project aims to transition an existing energy prosumer network
simulator towards a Belief-Desire-Intention ( BDI ) multi-agent architecture. 

CURRENT STATE: The existing simulator ( STONKSpp ) models prosumer energy trading 
but lacks a strong multi-agent system ( MAS ) framework. 

ENHANCEMENTS PROPOSED: Implement a BDI-based prosumer model. Develop communication protocols among 
agents using a message-passing paradigm. Compare implementations using python-agentspeak and Jason. 
Attempt integration with the Mango MAS framework to improve interaction capabilities. 

TECHNOLOGY USED: Mosaik & OMNeT++ for co-simulation. Python-agentspeak and Jason for agent modeling. 
Cosima & Mango to simulate realistic decentralized MAS behaviors. 

CHALLENGES: Moving from centralized optimization to fully distributed decision-making. Handling 
dynamic neighbor discovery and adapting to network conditions. Ensuring scalability and real-world applicability.
